# About the Redgate Tech Radar

The Redgate Tech Radar describes the technology landscape through a Redgate lens. It's a living document that represents our current thinking about the technology choices we make.

## How to Read the Radar

The radar is organized into four quadrants:

- **Languages and Frameworks**: Programming languages, frameworks, and libraries we use
- **Platforms**: Platform technologies including cloud, containers, and databases
- **Tools**: Development tools, IDEs, and CI/CD systems
- **Techniques**: Development techniques, patterns, and practices

Items are positioned in rings to reflect our recommendations:

- **Adopt**: We have high confidence in these technologies and recommend them for use
- **Trial**: We are currently trialing these technologies in production
- **Assess**: Worth exploring with the goal of understanding how they might help us
- **Hold**: Not recommended for new projects
