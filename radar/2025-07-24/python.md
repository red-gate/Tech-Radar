[Python](https://www.python.org/) is the most popular language for Machine Learning due to its extensive libraries, frameworks and data science community support. Teams starting new projects that involve AI/ML should default to Python, especially if model training is needed. When used as a scripting tool, Python provides a powerful language for gluing components together. We encourage trialling Python when the alternative would be a large Bash script (caveated by why isn't it easy to write a Bash script?).
