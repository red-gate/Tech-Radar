Team Exploratory Testing Sessions,adopt,techniques,false,"Team exploratory testing helps us gain deep feedback on development work."
Lightweight Architecure Decision Records,adopt,techniques,false,"Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of evolutionary architecture, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Lightweight Architecture Decision Records is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We store these details in source control, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself."

Mob Programming,adopt,techniques,false,"Mob Programming is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. The SQL Prompt team experimented with it and found it to be very useful for understanding different team members approaches, how they code, to learn together and to some extent, a team bonding experience. The Orcas also used 'mobbing by default' during their first few months as a team and found it really effective. Following on from Woody Zuill's workshop on the subject, most if not all of the teams in Product and Foundry are looking to do more mob programming."
Domain-driven Design,explore,techniques,false,"Domain-driven Design (DDD) is a development approach that deeply values the domain model and connects it to the implementation. DDD gives us the opportunity to keep ourselves honest about striving for persistence ignorance by abstrating the consistency boundaries through proper domain modeling. We are finding it easy to shape the discussions around business language and structure the codebase around the well-established DDD concepts such as Aggregate, Command, Event, etc. There is a also great deal of resource and community support behind this approach which makes it easy to acquire the knowladge. Being explored by The Spiders."
Property-based testing,explore,techniques,false,"Property-based testing is a technique of writing tests in a manner where you express the property (characteristic) of the component. You don't provide particular values as an input, but usually, you let a sophisticated framework to generate a lot of test cases (usually limited to 100 by default) from all possible range of input and algorithm tries to find as fast as possible a fail case. Being explored by DataMasker team and we are using FsCheck to do it."

Delphi,endure,languages and frameworks,false,"SQL Backup engine is written in Delphi."
JavaScript (pre ES6),endure,languages and frameworks,false,"We don't use older versions of JavaScript. ES6 features like promises, modules and classes significantly improve the JavaScript experience, and tools like BabelJS allow us to adopt this with confidence. We will update older JavaScript implementations when possible, but will not actively retire them across our codebase."
JavaScript (ES6+),adopt,languages and frameworks,false,"We use JavaScript for rapid prototyping of ideas because it allows us to go faster. In code bases where we already have significant JavaScript we will continue to use modern JavaScript."

In the last three years, Microsoft have done a lot of work on OneDrive and the associated sync clients and have closed the gap on their competitors. The sync client is very stable and doesn’t contain the restrictions that it did before."
Raygun error reporting,adopt,tools,false,"Raygun allows loosely-coupled error reporting to a web endpoint. Raygun offers other capabilities too, but we only use the error reporting. Ideally our choice of error provider would be a server-side decision, but RedGate.Usage.Client doesn't currently support error reporting"
Google Drive,retire,tools,false,"We don’t have corporate Google accounts and it doesn’t make sense to subscribe to both GSuite and Office 365, both for cost reasons and from an information management point of view. The fact that we don’t have corporate accounts means data can’t be removed from Google accounts when someone leaves the company (as we don’t own the account), so we shouldn’t be storing any personal information (such as customer data) in Google Drive."

It is also the only browser available by default on the server versions of Windows (including Windows Server 2019). Even though, for new products, it does not need to be supported. For products that are supporting IE 11 and feeling the pain, the next major version is the point you can drop the support (when confirmed with the Product Owner). Consider supporting IE 11 for admin interfaces or initial setup that is supposed to be done directly on the server."
IE 10 and under,endure,platforms,false,"We do not support IE10 and under. Any implementation to support IE10 can be removed, but there is no strong drive to do so across our codebase."
Raven DB,retire,tools,false,"We previously used Raven DB in DLM Dashboard but our experience was not positive."
Fakes,explore,techniques,false,"We've experimented using <a href='https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Test-Double'>Fakes</a> in the Redgate Usage Client - fakes used in the test can reduce the amount of mocking is required and can make the tests simpler."

"Release Management: User-controlled background updates",explore,techniques,false,"Allowing a user to kick off a background upgrade of products, from the UI. The only drawback of the current mechanism is the lack of support for changelogs and alerts for breaking changes. Being explored by ICloneable&lt;Sheep&gt; on SQL Clone."

"Four Key Metrics",explore,techniques,false,"The thorough <a href='https://devops-research.com/research.html'>State of DevOps reports</a> have focused on data-driven and statistical analysis of high-performing organizations. The result of this multiyear research, published in <a href='https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/'>Accelerate</a>, demonstrates a direct link between organizational performance and software delivery performance. The researchers have determined that only four key metrics differentiate between low, medium and high performers: lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to restore (MTTR) and change fail percentage. We are instrumenting our build pipelines to track these metrics at Redgate to learn how we can use them to drive performance improvements. The metrics themselves are available internally at <a href='http://acceleratemetrics.red-gate.com'>acceleratemetrics.red-gate.com</a>."
