Team Exploratory Testing Sessions,adopt,techniques,TRUE,Team exploratory testing helps us gain deep feedback on development work.
Lightweight Architecure Decision Records,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of evolutionary architecture, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Lightweight Architecture Decision Records is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We store these details in source control, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself."
Mobbing,explore,techniques,TRUE,"Mobbing is a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. The SQL Prompt team are exploring mobbing."
Domain-driven Design,explore,techniques,TRUE,"Domain-driven Design (DDD) is a development approach that deeply values the domain model and connects it to the implementation. DDD gives us the opportunity to keep ourselves honest about striving for persistence ignorance by abstrating the consistency boundaries through proper domain modeling. We are finding it easy to shape the discussions around business language and structure the codebase around the well-established DDD concepts such as Aggregate, Command, Event, etc. There is a also great deal of resource and community support behind this approach which makes it easy to acquire the knowladge. Being explored by The Spiders."

OneDrive,adopt,tools,TRUE,"OneDrive is our default choice for storing Office documents to share within the organization. In the last three years, Microsoft have done a lot of work on OneDrive and the associated sync clients and have closed the gap on their competitors. The sync client is very stable and doesn’t contain the restrictions that it did before."
Raygun,explore,tools,TRUE,"Raygun allows loosely-coupled error reporting to a web endpoint. Currently being explored with SQL Prompt, SQL Clone and SQL Monitor."
Google Drive,retire,tools,TRUE,"We don’t have corporate Google accounts and it doesn’t make sense to subscribe to both GSuite and Office 365, both for cost reasons and from an information management point of view. The fact that we don’t have corporate accounts means data can’t be removed from Google accounts when someone leaves the company (as we don’t own the account), so we shouldn’t be storing any personal information (such as customer data) in Google Drive."
SmartAssembly,retire,tools,TRUE,"SmartAssembly obfuscation, error and usage reporting becomes tightly-coupled to products and slows down builds."
Windows 7+/2008R2+,adopt,platforms,TRUE,Our default supported operating system is Windows.

Raven DB,retire,tools,TRUE,We previously used Raven DB in DLM Dashboard but our experience was not positive.
NSubsitute,adopt,languages and frameworks,TRUE,NSubstitute is our default mocking library of choice. We feel it's got less setup cost than Moq and requires fewer .Object calls.
Moq,endure,languages and frameworks,TRUE,"Moq is a great framework for mocking, but we prefer NSubstitute's simplicity. We see no benefit in having a common mocking framework across solutions."
Fakes,explore,techniques,TRUE,We've experimented using <a href='https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Test-Double'>Fakes</a> in the Redgate Usage Client - fakes used in the test can reduce the amount of mocking is required and can make the tests simpler.

Build magic,retire,tools,TRUE,"Legacy build tooling, now to be deprecated in favour of RedGate.Build."
IL weaving,retire,tools,TRUE,Byte weaving magic is not desirable as it adds compile time complexity that is often not visible to developers. Please note that this does not incorporate static linker tools such as ILMerge as they can still be useful to make some components more reusable by internalising a subset of their dependencies.
Fody,retire,tools,TRUE,Tool for IL weaving. No longer endorsed.

JQuery,retire,languages and frameworks,TRUE,JQuery has had it's time. Modern browsers and advances in JavaScript means we don't require it any more.
Manual releases,retire,techniques,TRUE,A release that involves someone manually going through a whole heap of steps across different systems is bad.
Release scripts,adopt,techniques,TRUE,"Using a single powershell script (basic-release.ps1 or using RG.Release) to manage your entire release process is a good trade off between saving effort, and security and accountability for each release."
Automated releases via Octopus Deploy,explore,techniques,TRUE,"Octopus is more trustworthy than TeamCity for automating releases (via @rmc47), so teams wishing to try this should first move their release process to Octopus. SQL Monitor currently uses Octopus for deploying to monitor.red-gate.com."
Trello,adopt,tools,TRUE,"Some teams use Trello for issue management and digital taskboards. Setup and administration are cheap, but issue management capabilities are limited."
Jira,adopt,tools,TRUE,"Some teams use Jira for issue management and digital taskboards. The setup and administration costs are higher than other tools, but issue management capabilities are rich."
