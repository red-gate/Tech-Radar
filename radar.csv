This prioritisation technique requires the majority of features / stories to be identified up front - this does not fit well with our exploratory approach to finding customer needs and drilling in based on our riskiest assumption. It also has the effect of creating fixed view of what will be delivered and can result in teams delivering work that is not valued by customers."
"Trunk is always releasable",adopt,techniques,false,"'Trunk as always releasable' is an ethos teams will follow and constantly strive to make true. We should have enough confidence in the product and automated tests that anyone can press the release button at any time. We release whenever we have something to release.

"Definition of Done",explore,techniques,false,"Scrum says that 'when ... is described as 'Done', everyone must understand what 'Done' means'. By agreeing up front what constitutes 'done' for a feature / story it can highlight any misunderstandings over what is expected from the story. The definition can also help ensure basic quality and ancillary tasks are completed e.g. documentation is updated. Tested across all operating systems / database versions etc. The Versioning teams will be trying to do this."

"Theory of Constraints",explore,techniques,false,"The Theory of Constraints is a method for identifying the most important limiting factor (i.e. constraint) that stands in the way of achieving a goal and then systematically improving that constraint until it is no longer the limiting factor. In manufacturing, the constraint is often referred to as a bottleneck. The application of this method in a software dev environment has a demonstrable benefit to task lead times, reduction in waste and, basically, deliver the most valuable stuff to users quicker. Dev Leads team will be running workshops (and, we hope, a book club) to help teams explore how applying the ToC can help them deliver the most valuable stuff to users quicker."
"Story Points",retire,techniques,false,"<a href='https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/what-are-story-points'>Story Points</a> are an example of abstract estimation.
