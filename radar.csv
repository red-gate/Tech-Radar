Team Exploratory Testing Sessions,adopt,techniques,false,"Team exploratory testing helps us gain deep feedback on development work."
Lightweight Architecture Decision Records,adopt,techniques,false,"Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of evolutionary architecture, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Lightweight Architecture Decision Records is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We store these details in source control, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself."
Pull Request Templates,adopt,techniques,false,"PR templates can pre-populate a pull request with a list of things to check before the PR is merged."
Domain-driven Design,explore,techniques,false,"Domain-driven Design (DDD) is a development approach that deeply values the domain model and connects it to the implementation. DDD gives us the opportunity to keep ourselves honest about striving for persistence ignorance by abstracting the consistency boundaries through proper domain modeling. We are finding it easy to shape the discussions around business language and structure the codebase around the well-established DDD concepts such as Aggregate, Command, Event, etc. There is also a great deal of resource and community support behind this approach which makes it easy to acquire the knowledge. Being explored by The Spiders."
Property-based testing,explore,techniques,false,"Property-based testing is a technique of writing tests in a manner where you express the property (characteristic) of the component. You don't provide particular values as an input, but usually, you let a sophisticated framework to generate a lot of test cases (usually limited to 100 by default) from all possible range of input and algorithm tries to find as fast as possible a fail case. Being explored by DataMasker team and we are using FsCheck to do it."
Isolated installer tests,adopt,techniques,false,"Automated tests that install in an isolated VM gives confidence that build is actually releasable. Ideally, both a clean install, and an upgrade install from the previous release, to ensure the installer works for both new and existing users."
C# 8,adopt,languages and frameworks,true,"We build our software using C#. We try to keep up to date with the latest version of C# possible as new language features help us write simpler code."
JavaScript (pre ES6),endure,languages and frameworks,false,"We don't use older versions of JavaScript. ES6 features like promises, modules and classes significantly improve the JavaScript experience, and tools like BabelJS allow us to adopt this with confidence. We will update older JavaScript implementations when possible, but will not actively retire them across our codebase."
JavaScript (ES6+),adopt,languages and frameworks,false,"We use JavaScript for rapid prototyping of ideas because it allows us to go faster. In code bases where we already have significant JavaScript we will continue to use modern JavaScript."
TypeScript,adopt,languages and frameworks,false,"TypeScript provides an advanced type system on top of JavaScript. We have a preference for TypeScript in production code because the optional type safety can help and improved tool support."
Balsamiq,adopt,tools,false,"Balsamiq gives us the ability to create quick low-fidelity wireframes to describe workflows."
OneDrive,adopt,tools,false,"OneDrive is our default choice for storing Office documents to share within the organization. In the last three years, Microsoft have done a lot of work on OneDrive and the associated sync clients and have closed the gap on their competitors. The sync client is very stable and doesn’t contain the restrictions that it did before."
Raygun error reporting,adopt,tools,false,"Raygun allows loosely-coupled error reporting to a web endpoint. Raygun offers other capabilities too, but we only use the error reporting. Ideally our choice of error provider would be a server-side decision, but RedGate.Usage.Client doesn't currently support error reporting"
Google Drive,retire,tools,false,"We don’t have corporate Google accounts and it doesn’t make sense to subscribe to both GSuite and Office 365, both for cost reasons and from an information management point of view. The fact that we don’t have corporate accounts means data can’t be removed from Google accounts when someone leaves the company (as we don’t own the account), so we shouldn’t be storing any personal information (such as customer data) in Google Drive."
SmartAssembly,retire,tools,false,"SmartAssembly obfuscation, error and usage reporting becomes tightly-coupled to products and slows down builds."
Windows 7+/2008R2+,adopt,platforms,false,"Our default supported operating system is Windows.

IE 11,endure,platforms,false,"IE 11 is the default browser on Windows 10 and makes up approximately 8% of the visits to Redgate.com. It is also the only browser available by default on the server versions of Windows (including Windows Server 2019). Even though, for new products, it does not need to be supported. For products that are supporting IE 11 and feeling the pain, the next major version is the point you can drop the support (when confirmed with the Product Owner). Consider supporting IE 11 for admin interfaces or initial setup that is supposed to be done directly on the server."
IE 10 and under,endure,platforms,false,"We do not support IE10 and under. Any implementation to support IE10 can be removed, but there is no strong drive to do so across our codebase."
Fakes,explore,techniques,false,"We've experimented using <a href='https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Test-Double'>Fakes</a> in the Redgate Usage Client - fakes used in the test can reduce the amount of mocking is required and can make the tests simpler."

Check for Updates (CfU),endure,tools,false,"Redgate's established mechanism for distributing product upgrades. The update process is manual and intrusive for users, leading to slow version uptake and version fragmentation in production. We're keen to explore alternatives."
"Release Management: User-controlled background updates",explore,techniques,false,"Allowing a user to kick off a background upgrade of products, from the UI. The only drawback of the current mechanism is the lack of support for changelogs and alerts for breaking changes. Being explored by ICloneable&lt;Sheep&gt; on SQL Clone."

"XML",endure,tools,false,"For storing user information we used to use XML. We'll continue to use that, but avoid it in the future because it's very verbose. We perceive the cost of migration away to be high enough for this to be Endure, rather than Retire."
"Registry",endure,tools,false,"We avoid storing settings in the Registry as it's Windows specific. However, it does make it easier for system administrators to apply group policy so we should bear this in mind when choosing setting locations."
"Feature flags",adopt,techniques,false,"<a href='https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html'>A mechanism to prevent code in master from affecting the way the product behaves</a>. There are lots of different types of flags/toggles: they might be set at compile or run time; they might be purely internal or visible to the user, and so on."

This approach also encourages teams to fix flaky tests."
"Frequent update release channels",endure,techniques,false,"Allowing users to opt-in to more regular product updates, allowing quicker feedback for Redgate, while maintaining a slower-cadence release channel for other users. This is in-place with SQL Source Control and SQL Compare, but we prefer simpler releasing mechanisms ('Single release channel') and leaving control in the hands of the user."

"Private builds",endure,techniques,false,"Shipping a release that isn't publically available to all users, typically for feedback from a specific customer. We prefer other delivery mechanisms for getting this feedback, like improved logging and feature flagging in public releases, rather than version fragmentation. Putting these in place can be time-consuming, so we endure using private builds where necessary."
"RESTful APIs",adopt,techniques,false,"<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer'>RESTful APIs</a> are an architectural style that defines a set of constraints for creating web services.
