Lightweight Architecure Decision Records,adopt,techniques,true,"Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of evolutionary architecture, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Lightweight Architecture Decision Records is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We store these details in source control, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself."
Mobbing,explore,techniques,true,We've been experimenting with mob programming
Domain-driven Design,explore,techniques,true,"Domain-driven Design (DDD) is a development approach that deeply values the domain model and connects it to the implementation. DDD gives us the opportunity to keep ourselves honest about striving for persistence ignorance by abstrating the consistency boundaries through proper domain modeling. We are finding it easy to shape the discussions around business language and structure the codebase around the well-established DDD concepts such as Aggregate, Command, Event, etc. There is a also great deal of resource and community support behind this approach which makes it easy to acquire the knowladge.

.NET Core,adopt,languages and frameworks,true,Microsoft has delivered a cross-platform future. New applications should be built with .NET Core by default
.NET Framework,endure,languages and frameworks,true,With the advent of .NET CORE we should not use .NET Framework to build any more products
C#,adopt,languages and frameworks,true,We build our software using C#
F#,explore,languages and frameworks,true,F# has some great test and data parsing and manipulating libraries, that are worth exploring as our development becomes more data and api oriented. 
C++,endure,languages and frameworks,true,C++ was the right tool for the job in the past
Delphi,endure,languages and frameworks,true,SQL Backup engine is written in Delphi
VB.Net,retire,languages and frameworks,true,There is no reason to prefer VB.Net over C#
JavaScript,endure,languages and frameworks,true,Whilst JavaScript is the lingua franca of the web we prefer TypeScript for the benefits of type safety and IDE integrations

Autofac,adopt,languages and frameworks,true,"Autofac is an Inversion of Control container for .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, .NET 4.5.1+ and our preferred IoC container choice. Autofac allows you to register components and express dependencies through its flexible module system and simple extension points."
Rhino Mocks,endure,languages and frameworks,true,Moq is our preferred framework
Ninject,endure,languages and frameworks,true,"Ninject is a dependency injector for .NET applications. However, Autofac is our preferred IoC container."
Balsamiq,adopt,tools,true,Balsamiq gives us the ability to create quick low-fidelity wireframes to describe workflows
Git,adopt,tools,true,Git is our defacto VCS.
OneDrive,adopt,tools,true,"OneDrive is our default choice for storing Office documents to share within the organization. In the last three years, Microsoft have done a lot of work on OneDrive and the associated sync clients and have closed the gap on their competitors.

Raygun,explore,tools,true,Raygun allows loosely-coupled error reporting to a web endpoint.
Google Drive,retire,tools,true,"We don’t have corporate Google accounts and it doesn’t make sense to subscribe to both GSuite and Office 365, both for cost reasons and from an information management point of view. The fact that we don’t have corporate accounts means data can’t be removed from Google accounts when someone leaves the company (as we don’t own the account), so we shouldn’t be storing any personal information (such as customer data) in Google Drive."
SmartAssembly,retire,tools,true,SmartAssembly obfuscation and error reporting becomes tightly-coupled to products and slows down builds.
Windows,adopt,platforms,true,"Our default supported operating system is Windows. If Microsoft continues to support this as part of their default support package we continue to support running our applications on that OS. See https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet"
