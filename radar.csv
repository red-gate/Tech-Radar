If you want to deploy a new application or update an existing one, you only need to update the repository - the automated process handles everything else. It’s like having cruise control for managing your applications in production. <a href='https://www.gitops.tech/'>Read more</a>, currently being trialled for Platform Hosted"
"DAPR",trial,"Languages and Frameworks",true,"DAPR (Distributed Application Runtime - <a href='https://dapr.io/'>https://dapr.io/</a>) is an abstraction layer for use in a distributed application, currently being trialled by Platform for both Hosted and Enterprise.
