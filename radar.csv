Daily standups,adopt,techniques,true,Having a daily standup each day helps us prepare to have the best possible day
Pairing,adopt,techniques,true,Pairing helps collaboration and knowledge transfer within the team.
Team Exploratory Testing Sessions,adopt,techniques,true,Team exploratory testing helps us gain deep feedback on development work.
Lightweight Architecure Decision Records,adopt,techniques,true,"Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of evolutionary architecture, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Lightweight Architecture Decision Records is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We store these details in source control, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself."
Mobbing,explore,techniques,true,We've been experimenting with mob programming
Domain-driven Design,explore,techniques,true,"Domain-driven Design (DDD) is a development approach that deeply values the domain model and connects it to the implementation. DDD gives us the opportunity to keep ourselves honest about striving for persistence ignorance by abstrating the consistency boundaries through proper domain modeling. We are finding it easy to shape the discussions around business language and structure the codebase around the well-established DDD concepts such as Aggregate, Command, Event, etc. There is a also great deal of resource and community support behind this approach which makes it easy to acquire the knowladge. "
.NET Core,adopt,languages and frameworks,true,Microsoft has delivered a cross-platform future. New applications should be built with .NET Core by default
.NET Framework,endure,languages and frameworks,true,With the advent of .NET CORE we should not use .NET Framework to build any more products
C#,adopt,languages and frameworks,true,We build our software using C#
F#,explore,languages and frameworks,true,"F# has some great test and data parsing and manipulating libraries, that are worth exploring as our development becomes more data and api oriented."
C++,endure,languages and frameworks,true,C++ was the right tool for the job in the past
Delphi,endure,languages and frameworks,true,SQL Backup engine is written in Delphi
VB.Net,retire,languages and frameworks,true,There is no reason to prefer VB.Net over C#
JavaScript,endure,languages and frameworks,true,Whilst JavaScript is the lingua franca of the web we prefer TypeScript for the benefits of type safety and IDE integrations
TypeScript,adopt,languages and frameworks,true,TypeScript provides an advanced type system on top of JavaScript. We prefer this for compile errors rather than runtime.
Autofac,adopt,languages and frameworks,true,"Autofac is an Inversion of Control container for .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, .NET 4.5.1+ and our preferred IoC container choice. Autofac allows you to register components and express dependencies through its flexible module system and simple extension points."
Ninject,endure,languages and frameworks,true,"Ninject is a dependency injector for .NET applications. However, Autofac is our preferred IoC container."
NUnit 2,endure,languages and frameworks,true,"NUnit is our default framework for writing unit and integration tests. NUnit 2 is working well in most projects that use it, but consider upgrading to NUnit 3 for newer features."
NUnit 3,adopt,languages and frameworks,true,"NUnit is our default framework for writing unit and integration tests. We use NUnit 3 by default for new projects."
Balsamiq,adopt,tools,true,Balsamiq gives us the ability to create quick low-fidelity wireframes to describe workflows
Git,adopt,tools,true,Git is our defacto VCS.
OneDrive,adopt,tools,true,"OneDrive is our default choice for storing Office documents to share within the organization. In the last three years, Microsoft have done a lot of work on OneDrive and the associated sync clients and have closed the gap on their competitors. The sync client is very stable and doesn’t contain the restrictions that it did before."
Raygun,explore,tools,true,Raygun allows loosely-coupled error reporting to a web endpoint.
Google Drive,retire,tools,true,"We don’t have corporate Google accounts and it doesn’t make sense to subscribe to both GSuite and Office 365, both for cost reasons and from an information management point of view. The fact that we don’t have corporate accounts means data can’t be removed from Google accounts when someone leaves the company (as we don’t own the account), so we shouldn’t be storing any personal information (such as customer data) in Google Drive."
SmartAssembly,retire,tools,true,"SmartAssembly obfuscation, error and usage reporting becomes tightly-coupled to products and slows down builds."
Windows,adopt,platforms,true,"Our default supported operating system is Windows. If Microsoft continues to support this as part of their default support package we continue to support running our applications on that OS. See https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet"
Chrome,adopt,platforms,true,"Chrome is Google's evergreen browser. We support it by default"
Firefox,adopt,platforms,true,"Firefox is Mozilla's evergreen browser. We support it by default"
Edge,adopt,platforms,true,"Edge is Microsoft's evergreen browser. We support it by default"
IE 11,adopt,platforms,true,"IE 11 is the default browser on Windows 10 and makes up approximately 10% of the visits to Redgate.com. We support it by default"
IE 10 and under,retire,platforms,true,"We do not support IE10 and under"
Raven DB,retire,tools,true,"We previously used Raven DB in DLM Dashboard but our experience was not positive."
NSubsitute,adopt,languages and frameworks,true,"NSubstitute is our default mocking library of choice. We feel it's got less setup cost than Moq and requires fewer .Object calls"
Moq,endure,languages and frameworks,true,"Moq is a great framework for mocking, but we prefer NSubstitute's simplicity. We see no benefit in having a common mocking framework across solutions"
Fakes,explore,techniques,true,"We've experimented using Fakes (see https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Test-Double for definition) in the Redgate Usage Client - fakes used in the test can reduce the amount of mocking is required and can make the tests simpler"
Rhino Mocks,retire,languages and frameworks,true,"Rhino Mocks is no longer actively maintained, nor does it support .NET Core / .NET Standard"
Wix 3,adopt,tools,true,"Windows Installer XML Toolset 3 (WiX), is a free software toolset that builds Windows Installer packages from XML. We default to Wix v3."
Wix 2,retire,tools,true,"Windows Installer XML Toolset 2 (WiX), is a free software toolset that builds Windows Installer packages from XML. We default to Wix v3."
Inno Setup,endure,tools,true,"SQL Backup uses divergent installer technology."
RedGate.Usage.Client,adopt,tools,true,"Redgate's standard tool for Product and Feature usage reporting"
AppInsights,adopt,tools,true,"Microsoft's platform for data analysis"
MixPanel,retire,tools,true,"Tool for presenting analytic data. Now superseded by AppInsights."
Google Analytics,retire,tools,true,"Tool for presenting analytic data. Now superseded by AppInsights."
SonarQube,adopt,tools,true,"Sonarqube provides automated code review, highlighting quality issues in changing code. This feedback is best surfaced through automated PR comments."
IL weaving,retire,tools,true,"Byte weaving magic is not desirable as it adds compile time complexity that is often not visible to developers. Please note that this does not incorporate static linker tools such as ILMerge as they can still be useful to make some components more reusable by internalising a subset of their dependencies."
Fody,retire,tools,true,"Tool for IL weaving. No longer endorsed."
