"Blazor.Net",assess,"Languages and Frameworks",true,"<a href='https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor'>Blazor</a> is super exciting. It means we might get to leverage our existing C# skills in the browser. It's too early for Redgate to commit to using this in production, so it's in assess so we can keep a good understanding of developments in this area."
"Visual Studio",adopt,"Tools",true,"Visual Studio is our default IDE for developing in C#. We get the Enterprise edition via our MSDN subscription."
"Rider",adopt,"Tools",true,"Many teams use Rider instead of Visual Studio for their development. We have licences for it."

"Keepass files in GitHub",hold,"Tools",true,"Use a password manager (or Vault) instead."
"Docker",adopt,"Tools",true,"Docker should be used as the default containerisation technology. Used for building, testing and deployment."
"gRPC",trial,"Tools",true,"<a href='https://grpc.io/'>gRPC</a> is a high-performance RPC framework which we may investigate for high-volume data collection (for example, SQL Monitor)."
"Snyk",adopt,"Tools",true,"We use Snyk to scan for known vulnerabilities in our products' dependencies."
"DocFx",trial,"Tools",true,"<a href='https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/'>DocFX</a> is an extensible and scalable static documentation generator. We're experimenting with it for the <a href='https://progression.red-gate.com'>web version of the progression framework</a>. Could this be a future solution to host our documentation too?"
"Makefiles",assess,"Tools",true,"Should we fall back to using Makefiles as part of a simpler build process? Again, this is part of our desire to simplify our build process."
"Cake",assess,"Tools",true,"<a href='https://cakebuild.net/'>Cake</a> is a free and OSS cross-platform build automation system with a C# DSL."

"Feature Flagging vendors (Launch Darkly?)",assess,"Tools",true,"If your usage of feature flagging becomes sufficiently complicated then it's time to investigate third-party vendors."
"Virtualbox based Vagrant boxes",hold,"Tools",true,"Use Docker instead where possible. UI and manual testing may still use Virtualbox."

"Infrastructure as code",adopt,"Techniques",true,"Infrastructure should be provisioned through code rather than manually (except for ad-hoc testing)"
"Automated code style settings",adopt,"Techniques",true,"Codebases should be formatted consistently. Automated code-style settings achieve this without fuss."
"Static code analysis (linters)",adopt,"Techniques",true,"Static code analysis is invaluable for automatically checking for problems in code. We use ESLint for JS and Roslyn-based analyzers for .NET. We also experimented with SonarQube but our implementation wasn't giving us confidence."

"Database Agnosticism",adopt,"Techniques",true,"We aim for feature parity between products that support different database engines."
"Feature Flags",adopt,"Techniques",true,"Feature Flags are a great technique for minimizing long-lived feature branches. Our recommendation is to focus on simplicity - if you find yourself writing substantial code to support Feature Flags, consider using a third-party solution."

"Git Ops",trial,"Techniques",true,"The core idea of GitOps is having a Git repository that always contains declarative descriptions of the infrastructure currently desired in the production environment and an automated process to make the production environment match the described state in the repository. If you want to deploy a new application or update an existing one, you only need to update the repository - the automated process handles everything else. It’s like having cruise control for managing your applications in production. <a href='https://www.gitops.tech/'>Read more</a>"
