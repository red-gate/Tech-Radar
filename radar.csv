Lightweight Architecture Decision Records,adopt,techniques,false,"Much documentation can be replaced with highly readable code and tests. In a world of evolutionary architecture, however, it's important to record certain design decisions for the benefit of future team members as well as for external oversight. Lightweight Architecture Decision Records is a technique for capturing important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. We store these details in source control, instead of a wiki or website, as then they can provide a record that remains in sync with the code itself."
Pull Request Templates,adopt,techniques,false,"PR templates can pre-populate a pull request with a list of things to check before the PR is merged."
Domain-driven Design,explore,techniques,false,"Domain-driven Design (DDD) is a development approach that deeply values the domain model and connects it to the implementation. DDD gives us the opportunity to keep ourselves honest about striving for persistence ignorance by abstracting the consistency boundaries through proper domain modeling. We are finding it easy to shape the discussions around business language and structure the codebase around the well-established DDD concepts such as Aggregate, Command, Event, etc. There is also a great deal of resource and community support behind this approach which makes it easy to acquire the knowledge. Being explored by The Spiders."
Property-based testing,explore,techniques,false,"Property-based testing is a technique of writing tests in a manner where you express the property (characteristic) of the component. You don't provide particular values as an input, but usually, you let a sophisticated framework to generate a lot of test cases (usually limited to 100 by default) from all possible range of input and algorithm tries to find as fast as possible a fail case. Being explored by DataMasker team and we are using FsCheck to do it."
